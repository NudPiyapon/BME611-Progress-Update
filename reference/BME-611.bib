	abstract = {Snoring, a form of sleep-disordered breathing, interferes with sleep quality and quantity, both for the person who snores and often for the person who sleeps with the snorer. Poor sleep caused by snoring can create significant physical, mental, and economic problems. A simple and natural solution for snoring is to sleep on the side, instead of sleeping on the back. In this project, a deep learning model for snoring detection is developed and the model is transferred to an embedded system—referred to as the listener module—to automatically detect snoring. A novel wearable gadget is developed to apply a vibration notification on the upper arm until the snorer sleeps on the side. The gadget is rechargeable, and it is wirelessly connected to the listener module using low energy Bluetooth. A smartphone app—connected to the listener module using home Wi-Fi—is developed to log the snoring events with timestamps, and the data can be transferred to a physician for treating and monitoring diseases such as sleep apnea. The snoring detection deep learning model has an accuracy of 96\%. A prototype system consisting of the listener module, the wearable gadget, and a smartphone app has been developed and tested successfully.},

	abstract = {In the past three decades, snoring (affecting more than 30 \% adults of the {UK} population) has been increasingly studied in the transdisciplinary research community involving medicine and engineering. Early work demonstrated that, the snore sound can carry important information about the status of the upper airway, which facilitates the development of non-invasive acoustic based approaches for diagnosing and screening of obstructive sleep apnoea and other sleep disorders. Nonetheless, there are more demands from clinical practice on finding methods to localise the snore sound's excitation rather than only detecting sleep disorders. In order to further the relevant studies and attract more attention, we provide a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art techniques from machine learning to automatically classify snore sounds. First, we introduce the background and definition of the problem. Second, we illustrate the current work in detail and explain potential applications. Finally, we discuss the limitations and challenges in the snore sound classification task. Overall, our review provides a comprehensive guidance for researchers to contribute to this area.},

	abstract = {This study proposes a health monitoring system for snoring detection utilizing Tiny Machine Learning ({TinyML}) models, specifically designed for resource-constrained wearable Internet of Things ({IoT}) devices. This research addresses significant constraints associated with running machine learning models on {IoT} devices, such as latency, limited memory, and low computational resources. These parameters are essential for real-time monitoring in healthcare applications, where prompt response is critical. The research focuses on developing a {TinyML} model capable of identifying specific audio patterns related to snoring during sleep. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world sleep environments with the {TinyML} model deployed on resource-constrained wearable {IoT} devices. The evaluation results show that the proposed model achieves high accuracy while utilizing minimal computational resources and without introducing latency issues. Through the integration of audio (Syntiant) and advanced audio preprocessing techniques, the proposed system improves the efficiency of the {TinyML} model on wearable devices. The quantized {TinyML} model achieved an accuracy of 95.85\% with a low latency of 48 ms, utilizing only 17.0K of {RAM} and 34.07K of flash memory for real-time snoring classification. This study highlights the benefits of practical deployment of the {TinyML} model for snoring detection on resource-constrained wearable {IoT} devices, demonstrating that such models can operate effectively within the constraints of current wearable technology.},
